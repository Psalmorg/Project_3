## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
 I learn of address tag and how to remove it default style and also get to create a circular image with  CSS

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<address>London, United Kingdom</address>
```
```css
img {
    width: 70px;
    height: 70px;
    border-radius: 50%;
}
```
